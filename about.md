This site is a quiet gathering place for reflections on mindfulnessâ€”observations of mind and body as they unfold.

Here, I share my thoughts and refelctions from meditation practice as well as insights gleaned from early Buddhist texts, contemporary teachers, and research.

There is no right or wrong, only the practice of seeing clearly in each moment. May these pages offer a calm space for your own exploration of presence.
